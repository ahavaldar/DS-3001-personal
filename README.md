### This repo is to showacase the projects I completed in DS 3001 at the University of Virginia. 

#### 1) MLpipeline_week05lab.rmd
- Uses machine learning processes to train, tune, and test different models on different data sets. 
- Covers one hot encoding, data partitioning, baseline/prevalence, cross validation, and model checking metrics (accuracy, FPR, FNR, AUC/ROC, etc)

### 2) NBA Scouting Final.rmd
- Utlizes clustering to offer advice on which NBA players would be best to sign based on certain metrics. 
- Covers kmeans clustering, elbow method, NBClust method, and plotly

### 3) final_code_cleaned.rmd
